# James Sargsyan — ML/AI Portfolio (Vision Edition)

This bundle contains **three hire-ready projects** with clean structure, tests, and docs.
Each repo includes a `ROADMAP.md` and bite-sized tasks so you can show meaningful commits quickly.

**Projects**
1. `federated-tabular-health` — Privacy-preserving ML with FedAvg vs centralized baseline.
2. `vision-fer2013-emotions` — CNN/transfer learning on FER-2013 with robust evaluation.
3. `rag-notes-helper` — RAG app over local notes with FAISS + small local model.

## Quick Start
1. Create three GitHub repos with the exact slugs.
2. Copy each folder into its repo, then `git init`, commit, and push.
3. Start with the first milestone in each `ROADMAP.md`. Aim for 1–3 commits/day.
